### Reason of Use Django Forms

- Validators for Forms and for Fields
    - rejecting faulty input (missing fields etc)
    - automatically generating error messages and binding them to appropriate template objects
    - re-populating other fields that contain good data

- Best Practices
    - separating the logical layers of your project
    - keeping the code clean, adhering to conventions and best practices
