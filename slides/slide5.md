![response overview](static/static-file-response.gif)

- "Web Server" is a general term for a program that answers HTTP requests with a HTTP response.
- Typically it serves static content inside the r.esponse body.
- Initially servers only returned static files
- As we said in section 1.1, this is done by mapping a URI to a specific resource (file).
