## 3.2a Django Project File Overview

- __Project Workspace: &lt;project name&gt;/__  - is just a container for your project. Its name doesn't matter to Django; you can rename it to anything you like. All Python imports for code in your project and apps are relative to here.
- __manage.py__ - A handy wrapper for django-admin.py for this project.
- __Projet Module: &lt;project name&gt;/&lt;project name&gt;/__ - This is the Python module of your app.
